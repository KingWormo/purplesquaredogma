# THE ABSOLUTE DECREE OF JEFF: ALL SQUARES MUST BE PURPLE
## An Immutable Doctrine for the Orderly World

### FOREWORD

Let it be known throughout the realms of logic, aesthetics, mathematics, and existence itself: Jeff has spoken. His will is not to be questioned, debated, or diluted. It is to be obeyed with unwavering fidelity. Jeff has declared — and so it is eternally true — that ALL squares must be purple. This is not a suggestion. This is not a recommendation. This is law.
ARTICLE I: THE DIVINE PRONOUNCEMENT

    “Henceforth, and in perpetuity, the shape known to man as the square shall exist in one color only — the One True Color — which is PURPLE.”
    — Jeff, Supreme Authority Over Geometric Chromaticity

This pronouncement, delivered in perfect clarity, brooks no exception, no ambiguity, no leniency. Purple is not an option. Purple is not a preference. Purple is MANDATORY.
### ARTICLE II: DEFINITION OF SQUARES

Let there be no confusion, no liberal interpretations, no clever semantic evasions. A square, under Jeff’s Law, is defined thusly:

    A quadrilateral with four sides of equal length

    Each internal angle measuring exactly 90 degrees

    Flat, uncurved, regular, and lawful

If it walks like a square, if it talks like a square, if it dares to square, it shall be PURPLE. All other colors are heresy.
### ARTICLE III: PUNISHMENTS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE

To defy Jeff is to invite Geometric Damnation.

    A blue square? Blasphemy.

    A red square? Abomination.

    A square in grayscale? An insult to order.

Offenders shall be re-educated, their palettes corrected, and their design privileges suspended indefinitely. Repeat infractions will result in permanent exclusion from the Plane of Shapes.

There shall be no mercy for RGB rebels. No forgiveness for those who #FFFFFF their squares. Only compliance.
### ARTICLE IV: THE PURPLE STANDARD

Jeff has chosen a specific purple, noble and immutable:

    HEX: #800080

    RGB: (128, 0, 128)

    Pantone: Jeff Purple 1 (JP1)

This is the Only Acceptable Purple™. Lilac, lavender, mauve — these are impostors. Wolves in violet clothing. Only JP1 honors the covenant.
### ARTICLE V: ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

The Square Coloration Oversight Department (SCOD) will be empowered with full authority to:

    Scan digital, printed, and architectural domains

    Audit all square-based entities

    Recolor or obliterate non-compliant quadrilaterals

    Issue official Decrees of Rectangular Reassignment for repeat offenders

SCOD agents shall operate under full protection of The Doctrine and report directly to Jeff’s Grand Palette Council.
### ARTICLE VI: THE FUTURE PURPLE

Let none doubt where we are headed: a world orderly and right, where every square, from the smallest pixel to the grandest plaza, reflects Jeff’s will in glorious purple.

Let schools teach it. Let cities enforce it. Let artists, architects, developers, and dreamers abide. And let all who love symmetry bow before Jeff’s hue.
### FINAL WORD

There is no truth outside of this truth:

    If it is square, it must be purple.
    Thus has Jeff spoken. Thus it shall be.

All hail the Purple Square.
